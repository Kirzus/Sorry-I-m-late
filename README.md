# Sorry I'm Late.

Sorry I'm Late is a web app that generates (almost) real excuses for when you're late somewhere ! 

## Features :

  * Get an excuse linked to real transport disruptions in Paris (metro, train, tram or car traffic)
  
  * If you don't plan on giving your boss a believable excuse at least you can give him a laugh with a well-memed excuse ;)


Try it out !
